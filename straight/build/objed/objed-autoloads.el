defaults to char object. Otherwise uses associated

back to `objed-initial-object' if no match found.

Enable objeds modal editing features after certain commands.

With a prefix argument ARG, enable Objed mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise. If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.

Objed mode is a global minor mode. When enabled, any command
configured in `objed-cmd-alist' will activate modal navigation
and editing features on text objects. Available commands,
operations and objects can be found in `objed-map',
`objed-op-map' and `objed-object-map'.

To define your own text objects and editing operations see
`objed-define-object' and `objed-define-op'.
